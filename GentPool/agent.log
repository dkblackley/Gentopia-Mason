INFO:root:The current state-of-the-art single-server PIR, OnionPIR [MCR21], achieves a rate of 0.24 and a throughput of 149
MB/s. In contrast, the fastest two-server PIR scheme can achieve an essentially optimal rate of ≈1 and a throughput
of5.5GB/s [HH19]. Thus, there remains a large gap between the performance of the best single-server PIR and the
best two-server PIR protocols.
This work. In this work, we introduce S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc , a new family of lattice-based single-server PIR schemes that enables
new trade-oﬀs in communication and computation. The basic instantiation of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc simultaneously achieves a
4.5×reduction in query size, a 1.5×increase in the rate, and a 2×increase in the server throughput compared to
OnionPIR [MCR21] (see Table 2).
Like previous PIR protocols [ACLS18, GH19, PT20, ALP+21, MCR21, AYA+21], the S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc protocol works in the
model where the client starts by sending the server a set of query-independent public parameters. The server uses
these parameters along with the client’s query to compute the response. Since these parameters can be reused for an
arbitrary number of queries and they are independent of the query, the client can transmit these parameters to the
server in a separate “oﬄine” phase. For this reason, we often distinguish between the oﬄine cost of generating and
communicating the public parameters and the online cost of generating the query and computing the response.
We also introduce several variants of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc that achieve higher server throughput and rates (i.e., reduced online
cost) in exchange for larger queries and/or public parameters:
•S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.sc : The S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.sc protocol variant is optimized for the streaming setting. In the streaming
setting, the client’s query is reused across multiple databases, so we can amortize the cost of query generation
and communication over multiple PIR responses. The S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.sc protocol has larger queries (30 MB), but
achieves a rate of 0.49 ( 2×higher than OnionPIR) and an eﬀective server throughput of up to 1.5GB/s (roughly
10×higher than OnionPIR). We provide more detailed benchmarks in Section 5.3 and Table 4.
•S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc : The S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc protocol leverages a new response packing technique that reduces the online
costs of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc (for databases with large records) at the expense of requiring a larger set of (reusable) public
parameters. As we show in Section 5.3 and Table 3, when database records are large, S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc can achieve a
30% higher rate compared to S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc while simultaneously providing a similar or higher server throughput.
The two optimizations we describe above can also be combined and we refer to the resulting protocol as S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc/hyphen.sc
S/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc . Compared to the other S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc variants, S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc has the largest public parameter and query
sizes, but is able to simultaneously achieve a high rate ( 0.81) and a high server throughput ( 1.9GB/s) on databases
with over a million records. This represents a 2.1×increase in rate and 5.5×increase in throughput compared to the
base version of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc . However, the size of the public parameters is 4.2×higher and the query size is over 2000×
higher. In absolute terms, the public parameter size increases from 30 MB to 125 MB and the query size increases
from 14 KB to 30 MB. We believe these remain reasonable for many streaming applications. Overall, for settings
where both the public parameters and the query will be reused for a large number of queries, S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc
likely oﬀers the most competitive performance.
We note that for databases with suﬃciently-large records ( ≥30KB), the server throughput of our streaming
constructions is 2–4×higher than that of full database encryption using a software-based AES implementation.
We believe that this is the /f_irst single-server PIR where the server throughput is faster than applying a symmetric
cryptographic primitive over the full database. Although this is still 2.9×slower than the best two-server PIR
using hardware-accelerated AES [HH19], hardware acceleration for the lattice-based building blocks underlying our
construction could help bridge this gap (e.g., [SFK+21]).
A limitation of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc is that it generally requires larger public parameters compared with previous schemes.
To compare, the public parameters in SealPIR [ACLS18], FastPIR [AYA+21], and OnionPIR [MCR21] are 3.4 MB,
1.4 MB, and 4.6 MB, respectively. In S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc , they range from 14 to 18 MB and for S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.sc , they range from
344 KB to 3 MB. The larger parameters in S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc are needed to enable our new ciphertext translation procedures
(Sections 1.2 and 3) that are critical for reducing the online costs of our protocol. The S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc variant requires
public parameters that range from 14 to 47 MB (in order to support ciphertext packing).

INFO:root:On the second page of David Wu's paper titled "Spiral: Fast, High-Rate Single-Server PIR via FHE Composition," the content discusses the performance of the current state-of-the-art single-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol, OnionPIR, which achieves a rate of 0.24 and a throughput of 149 MB/s. In contrast, the fastest two-server PIR scheme can achieve a rate of approximately 1 and a throughput of 5.5 GB/s. The paper introduces the Spiral family of lattice-based single-server PIR schemes, which enables new trade-offs in communication and computation.

Key points include:
- The basic instantiation of Spiral achieves a 4.5× reduction in query size, a 1.5× increase in rate, and a 2× increase in server throughput compared to OnionPIR.
- The protocol operates in a model where the client sends a set of query-independent public parameters to the server, which can be reused for multiple queries.
- Several variants of the Spiral protocol are introduced, optimized for different settings, such as streaming and response packing, each with varying trade-offs in terms of query size, rate, and server throughput.

The paper emphasizes the competitive performance of the Spiral protocol in comparison to existing schemes, particularly in scenarios where public parameters and queries are reused for multiple queries.
