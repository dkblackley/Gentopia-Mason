Abstract
We introduce the S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc family of single-server private information retrieval (PIR) protocols. S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc relies
on a composition of two lattice-based homomorphic encryption schemes: the Regev encryption scheme and the
Gentry-Sahai-Waters encryption scheme. We introduce new ciphertext translation techniques to convert between
these two schemes and in doing so, enable new trade-oﬀs in communication and computation. Across a broad range
of database con/f_igurations, the basic version of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc simultaneously achieves at least a 4.5×reduction in query size,
1.5×reduction in response size, and 2×increase in server throughput compared to previous systems. A variant of
our scheme, S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc , is optimized for the streaming setting and achieves a server throughput of 1.9GB/s
for databases with over a million records (compared to 200MB/s for previous protocols) and a rate of 0.81(compared
to0.24for previous protocols). For streaming large records (e.g., a private video stream), we estimate the monetary
cost of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc to be only 1.9×greater than that of the no-privacy baseline where the client directly
downloads the desired record.
1 Introduction
A private information retrieval (PIR) [CGKS95] protocol enables a client to download an element from a public
database without revealing to the database server which record is being requested. Beyond its direct applications
to private database queries, PIR is a core building block in a wide range of privacy-preserving applications such as
anonymous messaging [MOT+11, KLDF16, AS16, ACLS18], contact discovery [BDG15, DRRT18], private contact
tracing [TSS+20], private navigation [FKP15, WZPM16], and safe browsing [KC21].
Private information retrieval protocols fall under two main categories: (1) multi-server protocols where the
database is replicated across multiple servers [CGKS95]; and (2) single-server protocols where the database lives on a
single server [KO97]. We refer to [Gas04, OS07] for excellent surveys of single-server and multi-server constructions.
In many settings, multi-server constructions have reduced computational overhead compared to single-server
constructions and can often achieve information-theoretic security. The drawback, however, is their reliance on
having multiple non-colluding servers; this assumption can be challenging to realize in practice.
Conversely, single-server PIR protocols do not assume non-colluding servers. Instead, existing single-server PIR
implementations have signi/f_icantly higher computational costs compared to multi-server constructions. Indeed, it was
believed that single-server PIR would never outperform the “trivial PIR” of simply having the client download the entire
database [SC07]. While this assumption applied to earlier number-theoretic PIR schemes [KO97, CMS99, Cha04, GR05],
recent lattice-based constructions [MBFK16, ACLS18, GH19, PT20, AYA+21, MCR21] have made signi/f_icant strides in
concrete eﬃciency and are much faster than the trivial PIR in many settings.
When studying PIR protocols, we are primarily interested in the (1) rate, which is the ratio of the response size to
the size of the retrieved record; and (2) the server throughput , which is the ratio of the database size to the server’s
computation time. The rate measures the overhead in the server-to-client communication while the throughput
measures how fast the server can answer a PIR query as a function of the database size. A third quantity of interest is
the query size. Recent constructions are able to achieve relatively compact queries (e.g., 32–64 KB queries in the case
of [ACLS18, MCR21] for databases with millions of records and tens of gigabytes of data).

INFO:root:The current state-of-the-art single-server PIR, OnionPIR [MCR21], achieves a rate of 0.24 and a throughput of 149
MB/s. In contrast, the fastest two-server PIR scheme can achieve an essentially optimal rate of ≈1 and a throughput
of5.5GB/s [HH19]. Thus, there remains a large gap between the performance of the best single-server PIR and the
best two-server PIR protocols.
This work. In this work, we introduce S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc , a new family of lattice-based single-server PIR schemes that enables
new trade-oﬀs in communication and computation. The basic instantiation of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc simultaneously achieves a
4.5×reduction in query size, a 1.5×increase in the rate, and a 2×increase in the server throughput compared to
OnionPIR [MCR21] (see Table 2).
Like previous PIR protocols [ACLS18, GH19, PT20, ALP+21, MCR21, AYA+21], the S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc protocol works in the
model where the client starts by sending the server a set of query-independent public parameters. The server uses
these parameters along with the client’s query to compute the response. Since these parameters can be reused for an
arbitrary number of queries and they are independent of the query, the client can transmit these parameters to the
server in a separate “oﬄine” phase. For this reason, we often distinguish between the oﬄine cost of generating and
communicating the public parameters and the online cost of generating the query and computing the response.
We also introduce several variants of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc that achieve higher server throughput and rates (i.e., reduced online
cost) in exchange for larger queries and/or public parameters:
•S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.sc : The S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.sc protocol variant is optimized for the streaming setting. In the streaming
setting, the client’s query is reused across multiple databases, so we can amortize the cost of query generation
and communication over multiple PIR responses. The S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.sc protocol has larger queries (30 MB), but
achieves a rate of 0.49 ( 2×higher than OnionPIR) and an eﬀective server throughput of up to 1.5GB/s (roughly
10×higher than OnionPIR). We provide more detailed benchmarks in Section 5.3 and Table 4.
•S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc : The S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc protocol leverages a new response packing technique that reduces the online
costs of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc (for databases with large records) at the expense of requiring a larger set of (reusable) public
parameters. As we show in Section 5.3 and Table 3, when database records are large, S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc can achieve a
30% higher rate compared to S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc while simultaneously providing a similar or higher server throughput.
The two optimizations we describe above can also be combined and we refer to the resulting protocol as S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc/hyphen.sc
S/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc . Compared to the other S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc variants, S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc has the largest public parameter and query
sizes, but is able to simultaneously achieve a high rate ( 0.81) and a high server throughput ( 1.9GB/s) on databases
with over a million records. This represents a 2.1×increase in rate and 5.5×increase in throughput compared to the
base version of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc . However, the size of the public parameters is 4.2×higher and the query size is over 2000×
higher. In absolute terms, the public parameter size increases from 30 MB to 125 MB and the query size increases
from 14 KB to 30 MB. We believe these remain reasonable for many streaming applications. Overall, for settings
where both the public parameters and the query will be reused for a large number of queries, S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc
likely oﬀers the most competitive performance.
We note that for databases with suﬃciently-large records ( ≥30KB), the server throughput of our streaming
constructions is 2–4×higher than that of full database encryption using a software-based AES implementation.
We believe that this is the /f_irst single-server PIR where the server throughput is faster than applying a symmetric
cryptographic primitive over the full database. Although this is still 2.9×slower than the best two-server PIR
using hardware-accelerated AES [HH19], hardware acceleration for the lattice-based building blocks underlying our
construction could help bridge this gap (e.g., [SFK+21]).
A limitation of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc is that it generally requires larger public parameters compared with previous schemes.
To compare, the public parameters in SealPIR [ACLS18], FastPIR [AYA+21], and OnionPIR [MCR21] are 3.4 MB,
1.4 MB, and 4.6 MB, respectively. In S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc , they range from 14 to 18 MB and for S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.sc , they range from
344 KB to 3 MB. The larger parameters in S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc are needed to enable our new ciphertext translation procedures
(Sections 1.2 and 3) that are critical for reducing the online costs of our protocol. The S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc variant requires
public parameters that range from 14 to 47 MB (in order to support ciphertext packing).

INFO:root:David Wu's paper titled "Spiral: Fast, High-Rate Single-Server PIR via FHE Composition" introduces a new family of single-server private information retrieval (PIR) protocols called SPIRAL. This work focuses on improving the efficiency of single-server PIR systems, which allow a client to retrieve data from a database without revealing which specific record is being accessed.

### Key Contributions:
1. **Lattice-Based Homomorphic Encryption**: SPIRAL relies on a combination of two lattice-based homomorphic encryption schemes: the Regev encryption scheme and the Gentry-Sahai-Waters encryption scheme. This combination enables new techniques for ciphertext translation, which facilitate trade-offs in communication and computation.

2. **Performance Improvements**: The basic version of SPIRAL achieves significant performance enhancements:
   - **4.5× reduction in query size**
   - **1.5× increase in response size**
   - **2× increase in server throughput** compared to previous systems like OnionPIR.

3. **Streaming Optimization**: A variant of the protocol, optimized for streaming applications, achieves a server throughput of **1.9 GB/s** for databases with over a million records, which is a substantial improvement over previous protocols.

4. **Cost Efficiency**: For streaming large records, the estimated monetary cost of using SPIRAL is only **1.9× greater** than the baseline of directly downloading the desired record without privacy.

### Technical Details:
- The paper discusses the structure of the SPIRAL protocol, which operates in two phases: an offline phase where public parameters are generated and communicated, and an online phase where the client sends queries and receives responses.
- The authors introduce several variants of SPIRAL that optimize for different scenarios, such as larger records or higher throughput, while also discussing the trade-offs involved.

### Limitations:
- One limitation noted is that SPIRAL generally requires larger public parameters compared to previous schemes, which may affect its practicality in certain applications.

Overall, the SPIRAL protocol represents a significant advancement in the field of private information retrieval, particularly for single-server systems, by leveraging advanced encryption techniques to enhance both efficiency and privacy.
