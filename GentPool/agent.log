Abstract
We introduce the S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc family of single-server private information retrieval (PIR) protocols. S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc relies
on a composition of two lattice-based homomorphic encryption schemes: the Regev encryption scheme and the
Gentry-Sahai-Waters encryption scheme. We introduce new ciphertext translation techniques to convert between
these two schemes and in doing so, enable new trade-oﬀs in communication and computation. Across a broad range
of database con/f_igurations, the basic version of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc simultaneously achieves at least a 4.5×reduction in query size,
1.5×reduction in response size, and 2×increase in server throughput compared to previous systems. A variant of
our scheme, S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc , is optimized for the streaming setting and achieves a server throughput of 1.9GB/s
for databases with over a million records (compared to 200MB/s for previous protocols) and a rate of 0.81(compared
to0.24for previous protocols). For streaming large records (e.g., a private video stream), we estimate the monetary
cost of S/p.sc/i.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.scS/t.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/m.scP/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc to be only 1.9×greater than that of the no-privacy baseline where the client directly
downloads the desired record.
1 Introduction
A private information retrieval (PIR) [CGKS95] protocol enables a client to download an element from a public
database without revealing to the database server which record is being requested. Beyond its direct applications
to private database queries, PIR is a core building block in a wide range of privacy-preserving applications such as
anonymous messaging [MOT+11, KLDF16, AS16, ACLS18], contact discovery [BDG15, DRRT18], private contact
tracing [TSS+20], private navigation [FKP15, WZPM16], and safe browsing [KC21].
Private information retrieval protocols fall under two main categories: (1) multi-server protocols where the
database is replicated across multiple servers [CGKS95]; and (2) single-server protocols where the database lives on a
single server [KO97]. We refer to [Gas04, OS07] for excellent surveys of single-server and multi-server constructions.
In many settings, multi-server constructions have reduced computational overhead compared to single-server
constructions and can often achieve information-theoretic security. The drawback, however, is their reliance on
having multiple non-colluding servers; this assumption can be challenging to realize in practice.
Conversely, single-server PIR protocols do not assume non-colluding servers. Instead, existing single-server PIR
implementations have signi/f_icantly higher computational costs compared to multi-server constructions. Indeed, it was
believed that single-server PIR would never outperform the “trivial PIR” of simply having the client download the entire
database [SC07]. While this assumption applied to earlier number-theoretic PIR schemes [KO97, CMS99, Cha04, GR05],
recent lattice-based constructions [MBFK16, ACLS18, GH19, PT20, AYA+21, MCR21] have made signi/f_icant strides in
concrete eﬃciency and are much faster than the trivial PIR in many settings.
When studying PIR protocols, we are primarily interested in the (1) rate, which is the ratio of the response size to
the size of the retrieved record; and (2) the server throughput , which is the ratio of the database size to the server’s
computation time. The rate measures the overhead in the server-to-client communication while the throughput
measures how fast the server can answer a PIR query as a function of the database size. A third quantity of interest is
the query size. Recent constructions are able to achieve relatively compact queries (e.g., 32–64 KB queries in the case
of [ACLS18, MCR21] for databases with millions of records and tens of gigabytes of data).

ABSTRACT
This paper presents OnionPIR and stateful OnionPIR , two single-
server PIR schemes that significantly improve the response size and
computation cost over state-of-the-art schemes. OnionPIR scheme
utilizes recent advances in somewhat homomorphic encryption
(SHE) and carefully composes two lattice-based SHE schemes and
homomorphic operations to control the noise growth and response
size. Stateful OnionPIR uses a technique based on the homomor-
phic evaluation of copy networks. OnionPIR achieves a response
overhead of just 4.2x over the insecure baseline, in contrast to the
100x response overhead of state-of-the-art schemes. Our stateful
OnionPIR scheme improves upon the recent stateful PIR frame-
work of Patel et al. and drastically reduces its response overhead
by avoiding downloading the entire database in the offline stage.
Compared to stateless OnionPIR , Stateful OnionPIR reduces the
computation cost by 1.8∼22x for different database sizes.
1 INTRODUCTION
Protecting user privacy is becoming a critical concern to cloud ap-
plications and service providers. Private information retrieval (PIR)
is an important cryptographic primitive to protect user privacy
when fetching data from the cloud. Informally, PIR allows a user
to retrieve a particular entry from a public database without re-
vealing the identity of the entry to the database server. Recently,
PIR has been suggested for various applications, including anony-
mous communication [ 5,51], privacy-preserving media streaming
[40], ad delivery [ 39], location routing [ 32], contact discovery [ 11],
password-checking [2], and safe-browsing [46].
At a high level, PIR schemes can be classified into single-
server [2,4,14,19,33,47,49,50,53] ones and multi-server
ones [ 7,8,23,24,30,30,36,60,61,61]. Multi-server schemes are
generally more efficient but they need the stronger trust assump-
tion of multiple non-colluding servers. This requires coordination
from multiple organizations makes them hard to deploy in practice.
In this paper, we will focus on single-server PIR, which has thus
far been quite inefficient. The central goal of this project is to sub-
stantially improve the efficiency of single-server PIR schemes and
enable them for practical adoption.
In PIR, there are three main performance measures: the request
size, the response size , and the server’s computation cost . There are
often trade-offs between these measures. For example, a trivial
(singer-server) PIR scheme is to download the whole database. This
trivial scheme involves no server computation and has almost zero
request size, but it incurs a huge response size. State-of-the-art
single-server PIR schemes have achieved a reasonably small request
size. For example, SealPIR ’s request size can be made only 32KB
(after applying a standard optimization discussed in Section 4.3)
∗The work was partially done when Hao Chen was at Microsoft Research.for a database with up to four million entries [ 4]. But they are still
very expensive in terms of response size and server computation,
as we elaborate below.
•Large response. State-of-the-art single-server PIR schemes incur
around 100x overhead in response size. That means to fetch a 30
KB entry (e.g., an ad), the client needs to download 3MB of data.
•Heavy computation. State-of-the-art single-server PIR schemes
require heavy computation on the server. For example, SealPIR
requires about 400seconds of server computation to fetch a 30
KB file from a database with one million entries.
This paper addresses the above two performance issues of single-
server PIRs.
Main contribution 1. We first present a new single-server PIR
scheme we call OnionPIR that significantly improves the response
size. The main technique is to carefully control the noise growth
from the ciphertext operations on the server with the help of re-
cent advances in homomorphic encryption schemes. OnionPIR
has a mere 4.2x response size overhead (over the insecure base-
line), in contrast to the 100x overhead in state-of-the-art schemes
likeSealPIR . Concretely, to download a 30KB entry, the client in
OnionPIR only needs to download 128KB of data.
OnionPIR maintains a similar computation cost as SealPIR . The
small downside of OnionPIR is a slight increase in the client request
size for small databases. Specifically, for a database with one million
entries, the request size in OnionPIR is64KB, which is about twice
as large as SealPIR ’s request size of 32KB. However, we note that
the request size for OnionPIR remains 64KB even for all realistic
database sizes in practice. In contrast, the request size for SealPIR
starts to increase quickly once the database size exceeds four million:
it becomes 64KB for a database with 16millions entries and around
512KB for one billion entries.
Main contribution 2. Next, to address the computation issue, we
improve the Stateful PIR paradigm of Patel et al. [ 54] and integrate it
with OnionPIR . In stateful PIR, the client has a local state and uses
that state to make PIR queries cheaper [ 26,54]. The original stateful
PIR scheme of Patel et al. can already improve computation but it
requires the client to download the whole database in the offline
phase, which drastically increases the amortized response size. We
develop a new technique based on homomorphic evaluation of copy
networks [28,48] to reap the computation savings of stateful PIR
while increasing the amortized response size by only a factor of
two over stateless OnionPIR . The benefit of our stateful OnionPIR
scales with the size of the database. For database sizes from 216to
224, the reduction in computation over stateless OnionPIR ranges
from 1.8x to22x. Similarly, compared to the original stateful PIR
scheme of Patel et. al., the response size is reduced by 27∼3,900x.
These reductions also translate into better monetary costs of stateful

INFO:root:The paper "OnionPIR: Response Efficient Single-Server PIR" introduces two single-server private information retrieval (PIR) schemes, OnionPIR and stateful OnionPIR, which significantly enhance response size and computation efficiency compared to existing methods. OnionPIR achieves a response overhead of only 4.2 times the insecure baseline, a substantial improvement over the 100 times overhead seen in state-of-the-art schemes. The stateful variant further optimizes computation costs by leveraging homomorphic evaluation techniques, resulting in a reduction of computation costs by up to 22 times for larger databases. Overall, these advancements make OnionPIR a promising solution for practical applications requiring user privacy.
